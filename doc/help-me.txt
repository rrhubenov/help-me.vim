INTRODUCTION                                    *help-me*

Vim help is a powerful tool. This plugin allows you to install
collections of help files that are hosted on github.
Also adds some sensible mappings for easily navigating help files.

MAPPINGS                                        *help-me-mappings*

<CR> will jump to the help tag under the cursor.
<BS> will pop the last tag from the stack and jump back to it.

COMMANDS                                        *help-me-commands*
